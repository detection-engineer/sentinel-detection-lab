Azure Sentinel detection engineering and cloud security use cases

This repository demonstrates hands-on detection engineering and security operations work using Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Entra ID telemetry, and endpoint logs.

# Objectives
 - Design and tune SIEM detections for identity and endpoint threats
 - Apply MITRE ATT&CK mapping to detection logic
 - Simulate real-world attack scenarios in a controlled lab
 - Explore detection-as-code concepts using Sigma and Python

# Technologies
 - Microsoft Sentinel
 - Microsoft Entra ID Sign-in & Audit Logs
 - KQL (Kusto Query Language)
 - Sigma Rules
 - Python (Detection-as-Code)
 - Sysmon (Endpoint Telemetry)

# Detection Coverage (Planned/In Progress)

Initial focus is on identity and endpoint-based detections. Coverage will expand as detection logic is implemented and tuned

- Identity attacks (password spray, MFA fatigue, sign-in anomalies)
- Privileged role abuse
- Endpoint execution anomalies
